# Dust drop chances (out of 100)
# Ex: setting a chance to 1 will make give it a 1% chance of dropping.
# If you are not using a dust then set it's chance to 0.
# These base chances. See "Multipliers" below to choose modify percentages for other block types.
# Only use decimals up to the hundreds place: 1.25 is okay but 1.254 is not.
# Under "Mine" are the chances for breaking blocks and under "Kill" are chances for killing mobs
Chances:
  Dust:
    Mine:
      Common: 1
      Uncommon: .75
      Rare: 0.5
      Epic: 0.25
      Legendary: 0.1
    Kill:
      Common: 1
      Uncommon: .75
      Rare: 0.5
      Epic: 0.25
      Legendary: 0.1
    
# Below are multipliers for modifying the percentages above based on block type.
# Ex: a multiplier of 1 will use the above values while a multiplier of 2 will have double the chance to receive the drop.
# So with a multiplier of 2 will have a 1% chance of dropping common dust (with default settings where common dust usually has .5%).
# You may add custom material names to add more blocks that will drop dust.
# Ex: If you want nether quartz to drop dust, add QUARTZ_ORE: 1 to the list and it will now drop dust with default chances.
# To exclude a block from dropping dust remove it from this list
# Only use decimals up to the hundreds place: 1.25 is okay but 1.254 is not.
# Under "Blocks" is for mining. Please use material names from: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# Under "Mobs" is for killing mobs. Please use mob names from: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
